**Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

The initial artifact is a text-based treasure hunt game developed in Java for IT-145. The game involves navigating a virtual environment and collecting items to ultimately find the hidden treasure. It utilizes fundamental Java concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), conditional statements, loops, and data structures like arrays and lists to manage game elements and player interactions. The game was designed to be interactive and engaging, providing a basic but functional gaming experience.

I selected this artifact because it represents a foundational project where I first applied core programming principles. While functional, it lacked the elegance and efficiency I've come to appreciate through subsequent courses. The enhancement I propose is to completely rewrite the game in Python.

This transition from Java to Python showcases several key skills:

1. Language Proficiency: Demonstrates my ability to learn and apply a new programming language, specifically Python, and leverage its strengths.
2. Code Optimization: Python's syntax and libraries allow for a more concise and readable implementation compared to the original Java code. This highlights my understanding of code optimization and best practices.
3. Problem-Solving: Adapting the game logic and functionality from Java to Python requires a deep understanding of both languages and the ability to translate concepts effectively.
4. Object-Oriented Design: The enhancement will allow me to refine the object-oriented design of the game, potentially introducing new classes and relationships to improve modularity and maintainability.

**Reflection on the Enhancement Process:**

The enhancement will improve the artifact by making it more readable, maintainable, and potentially more feature-rich due to the ease of use of Python libraries.

The process of rewriting the game in Python will be a valuable learning experience. I anticipate facing challenges in translating specific Java concepts to their Python equivalents and leveraging Python's libraries effectively. I plan to actively seek feedback from peers and instructors throughout the development process. This feedback will be crucial in identifying areas for improvement and ensuring the Python version is a significant upgrade over the original Java implementation.

Specifically, I expect to learn more about:

1. Pythonic Code: Writing code that adheres to Python's conventions and best practices.
2. Python Libraries: Utilizing libraries like random for game logic and potentially curses for a more interactive terminal-based interface.
3. Code Refactoring: Improving the structure and organization of the code for better readability and maintainability.

**Course Outcomes:**

1. Applying programming principles to solve problems.
2. Developing software using different programming paradigms.
3. Demonstrating proficiency in multiple programming languages.
4. Collaborating effectively on software development projects.

**Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

The artifact is a collection of JUnit tests for CS320. JUnit Testing for CRUD Java application designed to validate the functionality of my CRUD Java application. These tests were initially created to cover the basic CRUD operations, ensuring data persistence, retrieval, modification, and deletion were functioning as expected.

I selected this artifact because it directly demonstrates my ability to apply software testing principles, a crucial skill for any software developer. The initial tests, while functional, were relatively simple and didn't fully explore edge cases or potential error conditions. Therefore, my enhancement focused on making both the tests and the program more complicated. This involved:

1. Expanding Test Coverage: Adding tests to cover boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and error handling scenarios.
2. Increasing Application Complexity: Introducing more complex data relationships and validation rules within the application itself.
3. Implementing Mocking: Utilizing mocking frameworks to isolate components and test them independently.

This enhancement significantly improved the artifact by ensuring a more comprehensive and well-rounded testing strategy. Specifically, I demonstrated skills in:

1. Test-Driven Development (TDD): Writing tests before implementing features to guide development.
2. Boundary Value Analysis: Identifying and testing edge cases to ensure robustness.
3. Exception Handling: Verifying that the application gracefully handles unexpected errors.
4. Dependency Injection and Mocking: Isolating and testing individual components in isolation.

**Reflection on the Enhancement Process:**

The process of enhancing the testing suite was incredibly valuable. I learned the importance of thinking critically about potential failure points and designing tests to proactively identify them. One challenge I faced was effectively mocking dependencies to isolate specific components for testing. I overcame this by researching different mocking frameworks and experimenting with various techniques.

Feedback from peers and instructors was instrumental in identifying gaps in my test coverage and suggesting improvements to my testing strategy. For example, I initially focused primarily on positive test cases, but feedback encouraged me to consider negative test cases and error handling more thoroughly. This led to a significant improvement in the overall robustness of the application.

**Course Outcomes:**

1. Designing and implementing software solutions using object-oriented principles. The CRUD application itself demonstrates this.
2. Applying software testing methodologies to ensure code quality. The JUnit testing suite and its enhancements directly address this.
3. Collaborating effectively in a team environment. (While this was an individual project, the feedback process simulated a collaborative environment.)
However, I feel that the outcome related to "managing complex software projects using industry-standard tools and techniques" was only partially met. While I used version control (Git), the scope of the project didn't fully encompass the complexities of managing a large-scale software project.

**Enhancement Three: Databases**

The core artifact is a MongoDB database built during CS340. It stores information about animals in a shelter, including their species, breed, age, color, and name. I chose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design and implement a NoSQL database solution, a crucial skill in modern software development. The initial database provided basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. However, the search functionality was limited and inefficient.

The enhancement involved implementing more sophisticated search capabilities, allowing users to search by multiple criteria simultaneously (e.g., searching for all available dogs under two years old). I also improved the user interface for interacting with the database, making it more intuitive and user-friendly. This enhancement showcases my skills in:

1. Database Design and Optimization: Improving query performance and data retrieval.
2. User Interface Design: Creating a more intuitive and efficient user experience.
3. Problem-Solving: Identifying and addressing limitations in the original design.
4. NoSQL Database Management: Demonstrating proficiency in working with MongoDB.

**Reflection on the Enhancement Process:**

Enhancing this artifact was a valuable learning experience. Initially, I underestimated the complexity of optimizing search queries in MongoDB. I learned a great deal about indexing strategies, aggregation pipelines, and the importance of data modeling for efficient querying. I faced challenges in implementing complex search filters and ensuring that the search results were accurate and relevant.

I actively sought feedback from my peers throughout the enhancement process. This feedback was instrumental in identifying areas for improvement, particularly in the user interface design.

The enhancement significantly improved the artifact by making it more practical and user-friendly. The improved search functionality allows shelter staff to quickly and easily find animals that match specific criteria, which can ultimately lead to more successful adoptions.

**Course Outcomes:**

I believe this enhancement partially or fully met the following course outcomes:

1. Design and implement database solutions: The artifact demonstrates my ability to design and implement a NoSQL database solution using MongoDB.
2. Apply software development principles: The enhancement process involved applying principles of software design, testing, and debugging.
3. Collaborate effectively: Seeking and incorporating feedback from others was a crucial part of the enhancement process.
I feel that the outcome related to large-scale system design was not fully met, as this project focused on a smaller-scale application.
