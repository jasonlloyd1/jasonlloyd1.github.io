**Introduction:**

Hello there, I'm Jason Lloyd, and I started the Computer Science degree program at SNHU in October 2022. This page is my final CS-499 Capstone project and ePortfolio, which completes my Bachelor of Computer Science degree.

**Professional Self Assessment**

Academically and professionally, completing the Bachelor of Computer Science degree has been an amazing experience. I have been able to hone the technical knowledge and abilities necessary to succeed in the profession of computer science throughout the program. More significantly, I now have a better idea of who I am as a professional and what I want to achieve. This ePortfolio gave me the chance to demonstrate my knowledge, emphasize my technical skills, and consider how my education has equipped me to make a significant contribution in the workplace. 

Throughout this program, I have found that completing coursework and developing the ePortfolio has significantly contributed to shaping my professional goals and values, showcasing my strengths, and preparing me to enter the computer science field. The process of selecting artifacts, reflecting on their significance, and articulating their impact has forced me to critically evaluate my skills and identify areas for further development.

Beyond the specific artifacts included in the ePortfolio, the program's curriculum has provided a solid foundation in key areas of computer science. For example, the rigorous coursework in data structures and algorithms has honed my problem-solving abilities and equipped me with the tools to design efficient and scalable solutions. Similarly, the software engineering and database courses have instilled best practices for developing robust and maintainable software systems. Furthermore, the emphasis on security principles throughout the program has heightened my awareness of potential vulnerabilities and the importance of secure coding practices.

My experiences collaborating in team environments, both within and outside of the formal curriculum, have been invaluable in developing my communication and interpersonal skills. Working on group projects has taught me the importance of effective communication, conflict resolution, and shared responsibility. I have also learned to adapt my communication style to effectively convey technical information to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

I am certain that I am ready to make a significant contribution to the field of computer science as I am ready to move on to the next stage of my career. I now have a solid technical basis and my dedication to problem-solving, professional integrity, and lifelong learning has been strengthened by this program.

Three examples of projects I've finished in past classes that showcase my proficiency in databases, software engineering, and data structures are included in the parts that follow. Along with a detailed explanation of each item, you will find the projects both before and after the enhancements. These artifacts successfully demonstrate the abilities I have acquired during my SNHU coursework.

**Course Outcomes**

I will illustrate the following course results in this ePortfolio:

1. Use techniques for creating cooperative settings that allow a range of audiences to assist in organizational decision-making in the computer science domain.
2. Create, produce, and present oral, written, and visual communications of the highest caliber that are technically sound, logical, and well tailored to particular audiences and situations.
3. Create and assess computational solutions that address a given issue while managing the trade-offs associated with design decisions by applying algorithmic concepts, computer science techniques, and standards relevant to the problem's solution.
4. Show that you can apply sound and creative methods, abilities, and resources in computing practices to build computer solutions that add value and achieve industry-specific objectives.
5. To identify possible weaknesses, address design faults, and guarantee privacy and improved security of data and resources, adopt a security mindset that foresees adversarial exploitation in software architecture and designs.

**Informal Code Review**

All three of the artifacts supplied in this portfolio are included in the code review that follows. I review each project separately, going over the functionality that is currently in place, any mistakes that will be fixed, and my plans for improving the project.

**Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

The initial artifact is a text-based treasure hunt game developed in Java for IT-140, Introduction to Scripting. The game involves navigating a virtual environment and collecting items to ultimately find the hidden treasure. It utilizes fundamental Java concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), conditional statements, loops, and data structures like arrays and lists to manage game elements and player interactions. The game was designed to be interactive and engaging, providing a basic but functional gaming experience.

I selected this artifact because it represents a foundational project where I first applied core programming principles. While functional, it lacked the elegance and efficiency I've come to appreciate through subsequent courses. The enhancement I propose is to completely rewrite the game in Python.

This transition from Java to Python showcases several key skills:

1. Language Proficiency: Demonstrates my ability to learn and apply a new programming language, specifically Python, and leverage its strengths.
2. Code Optimization: Python's syntax and libraries allow for a more concise and readable implementation compared to the original Java code. This highlights my understanding of code optimization and best practices.
3. Problem-Solving: Adapting the game logic and functionality from Java to Python requires a deep understanding of both languages and the ability to translate concepts effectively.
4. Object-Oriented Design: The enhancement will allow me to refine the object-oriented design of the game, potentially introducing new classes and relationships to improve modularity and maintainability.

The enhancement will improve the artifact by making it more readable, maintainable, and potentially more feature-rich due to the ease of use of Python libraries.


**Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

This artifact is a JUnit test case for a CRUD Java application that tests every method and verifies the data entered when interacting with a contact, appointment, and task generation system. It was first made for SNHU's CS-320 Software Testing course in September 2024. Since correctly testing software is an essential component of any application and I think it's a crucial talent, I included it in my portfolio. I didn't fully get JUnit tests or the concept of software testing in general when I first started this project. As a result, this project required numerous revisions and served as an excellent opportunity for me to hone my software test-building abilities.

I intended to make both the tests and the program itself more complicated. To make sure the application was comprehensively tested and well-rounded, I also intended to expand the coverage and close any test gaps. I did this by going over each Java class and the test classes that went with it. I found a lot of logical mistakes and testing holes. One frequent mistake I discovered was that I wrote the tests to check for data addition and update success, but I neglected to check for failures. I discovered problems with the program structure itself by fixing this logical flaw. I corrected all of these errors and rewrote all of the tests for the program to make them more complex and more thorough.

**Enhancement Three: Databases**

In October 2024, this artifact was initially produced for CS-340: Programming Concepts. In order to find animals that meet the requirements for different rescue animal needs, such as water, disaster, and mountain rescues, this project uses a MongoDB database that contains records of animal shelters. The data is then output in a dashboard format that can be interacted with by filtering data, viewing a map to find the locations of the animals, and searching for animals that meet these needs. I selected this project since there was a lot of room for improvement in the database's search functionality and interaction. By allowing the user to contribute entries to the dashboard—a new feature—I hoped to improve the search function and how it appears in the dashboard's graph while also improving the user interface.

Through the addition of UI capability to add new animals to the database and the improvement of search algorithms to make them more efficient, I was able to improve user interactions with the database. These enhance both the dashboard's and MongoDB's overall usefulness. In an application like this one, where the only goal is to manage and interact with database records, this feature is crucial.

Since Python was one of the first languages I learnt, I had to brush up on my skills before beginning this project because I hadn't used it much outside of this one lesson in a number of years. Because the initial environment I worked on was a pre-built virtual machine with all of my tools installed, it was equally challenging to set up and get working. Making it possible to test the code on my own machine with little recall of the tools used and how to set them up again was the most challenging aspect of this project. This helped me realize how crucial the right IDE is and that I should focus on the right configurations going forward. Additionally helpful would be documentation on how to set up these projects. Although most classes need a README file to be included with the final projects, it was never recommended to thoroughly document the tools used, even if this would have been useful in retrospect.
